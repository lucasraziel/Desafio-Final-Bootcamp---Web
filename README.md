## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have installe in your machine NodeJs, Redis, Postgresql and MongoDB. You should also have
an environment ready for react-native.

### Installing

#### Backend

To install the backend, these are the steps required:

You should start postresql, with a new database ready for it (the name is of you choice).

You should also start redis and mongodb server.


```
git clone https://github.com/lucasraziel/Meetapp-Server.git meetapp-server

cd meetapp-server

yarn

```

It is also required to setup the environment. The .env.example file must be renamed to
.env and must have its data complete according to your environment.


```
yarn sequelize db:migrate

yarn dev

yarn queue
```

The yarn queue command is only required if you wish that the application sends their emails.


#### Web

The web environment must be installed in this manner:

```
git clone https://github.com/lucasraziel/Meetapp-Web.git meetapp-web

cd meetapp-web

yarn

```

You must, then, edit src/services/api.js and edit the file to adjust your server
configuration

```
yarn start
```

#### Mobile

To install the react-native environment, It is a good idea to follow these instructions
(it is in brazilian portuguese) [instructions](https://react-native.rocketseat.dev/).

The src/services/api.js must be editted in the same way that was in web environment.

```
git clone https://github.com/lucasraziel/Meetapp-Mobile.git meetapp-mobile

cd meetapp-mobile

yarn

react-native run-android

react-native run-ios

```

The ios test will be only possible in mac OS.
